# Agile Project Log

Because of course we want to be agile and work through a series of stories as we build our app.

## MVP Phase


### Story 1

"As a user I should be presented with a landing page with the menu options of 'new', 'resume', 'find', 'create', 'settings'.  The menu options all go to placeholder pages, but should otherwise be functional.  Use the website '@https://fiveyears.minus99.com/ ' as inspiration for the design elements and visuals.

Acceptance criteria:

* The langing page has the required navigation items.
* The navigation items go to similarly styled stub pages."

### Story 2

"As a developer on this application I want to make sure we are not using any deprecated javascript or browser functions.  Other developers have mentioned the following warning:

Using `on:click` to listen to the click event is deprecated. Use the event attribute `onclick` instead

Let's move the code to the onlcick attribute before we procede.

Acceptance criteria:

* The `on:click` event handler is replaced with `onclick` attribute
"

### Story 3

"As a user the app window is opening too short to show the full landing menu.

Adjust the default app height by about 40% to display the entire menu and footer.

Acceptance criteria:

* The Tauri app opens about 40% taller so all menu items and the footer are visible."
