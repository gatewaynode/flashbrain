# FlashBrain

A Tauri Flash Mnemonic  App

## Description

This is a memorization reinforcement app designed to help structure memory implantation with
mnemomic presentation.  It reads from a JSON library of facts with the mnemoic images stored in
folder next to the json.  

# Vision-to-Language Learning App

**Tech Stack:** Svelte (Frontend), Rust (Backend), Tauri (App Shell)

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

A desktop application that visually introduces learners to content by first showing an image, then fading into associated text. This approach enhances memory by linking visuals with words. An optional feature highlights words one-by-one during display.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

### Core Goals
- Load lessons from a JSON file containing image + text pairs
- Display the image fullscreen
- Fade image into the associated text
- Fine controls over fade and flash speed up to 11 unique frames per second
- Allow user to replay, skip, or load a new lesson

### Stretch Goals
- Highlight each word sequentially as the image fades
- Custom per-word timing via JSON
- Optional voice narration synced with highlighting (future)
- Custom theming and font support

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

### Core
- *As a learner*, I want to see a picture before reading, to help memory.
- *As a user*, I want to replay the current content if I missed something.
- *As a user*, I want to load my own lesson sets via JSON files.

### Stretch
- *As a user*, I want each word highlighted to help focus on reading.
- *As an educator*, I want to control timing for different reading levels.

## ðŸ§± Non-Functional Requirements

- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Launch time < 2s
- Memory usage < 100MB
- Responsive design
- Async loading (no UI freeze)

---

## âš  Constraints & Risks

- Font and layout consistency across OSes
- Large image files may delay transition
- Highlight sync needs to avoid layout jitter
